# Game Hub

This application is a simple game searcher built with [React](https://react.dev/) and [Chakra-UI](https://chakra-ui.com/) using **TypeScript**.

It uses [React Query](https://tanstack.com/query/v4) for fetching and caching remote data and [Zustand](https://github.com/pmndrs/zustand) for state management.

All game information is obtained via the [rawg.io API](https://rawg.io/apidocs)
